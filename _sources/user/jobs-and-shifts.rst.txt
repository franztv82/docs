======================
Manage jobs and shifts
======================

Only admins can add new jobs and shifts or change them.

----
Jobs
----

Each job has a name (e.g. Security). You can decide for each job if it should
be visible publicly. If this is not set the registration is only possible
with a :ref:`link <links>` or for logged in users with
:ref:`the appropriate permission <access-control>`.

For some jobs is it necessary to have received some instructions for the
handling of food ("Gesundheitsbelehrung") from a doctor. If this is necessary
for a job a person that wants to register for it is asked if he has this thing.

You can and should add a description for each jobs.

.. seealso::
   The meaning of job admins is explained in :ref:`access-control`.

------
Shifts
------

You now can add shifts for a job. Each shift has a begin, an end and a maximal
number of helpers. Additionally you can add an optional name for each shift.

Even if the jobs is visible publicly you can block some shifts. They are
visible then but it is not possible to register with the public form. Again
the registration is possible with a link or for logged in users.

---------------------
Coordinators for jobs
---------------------

Beside helpers there are coordinators for each job that do not have a shift.

.. important::
   The coordinators have nothing to do with user accounts in the system.
   If someone is a coordinator for a job he has not automatically the access
   rights to manage this job. Therefor you have to add an user as job admin.
