.. _migration-3-0-0:

=============
Version 3.0.0
=============

The container was updated and requires slightly different parameters now.

With helfertoolctl
------------------

Make sure that you have ``helfertoolctl`` version ``0.9.0`` or later.
It will take care of all required changes automatically.

You can remove the following configuration from ``helfertool.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   docker: false

Other deployments
-----------------

The ``docker run`` command with the correct parameters can be found in the
`helfertoolctl script <https://github.com/helfertool/helfertoolctl/blob/ab37bcd9d5b008e8f708cfa236f21a369d04fbb9/src/helfertoolctl/helfertoolctl#L93>`_.

An example for ``podman`` can be found `here <https://github.com/helfertool/helfertool/blob/5c1a4f18d560bc51d08f845f8959a80693c5b259/scripts/container.sh#L86>`_.
