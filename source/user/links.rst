Links
=====

In case the event or specific jobs or shifts are not public, registration links can be created.
The registration via these links is always possible.

Just create a new link and select some shifts. You can change the shifts also after the link was sent.
Of course it is also possible to include a publicly visible job into a link.

The usage field is just for internal use to remember why a link was generated.

Links can only be created by admins, not by job admins.
