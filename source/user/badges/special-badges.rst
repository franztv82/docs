Special badges
==============

Special badges are badges, which are not associated with helpers and numbered serially, for example: Police 1, Police 2, etc.
This allows to create several similar badges without adding helpers manually.

Special badges are not deleted when the event is archived, so they can be reused.
Therefore, no personal data like names should be added here.

.. note::

   It is not possible to assign inventory items to these special badges.
