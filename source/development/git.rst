Git workflow
============

Currently, there are the following branches:

* ``master``: Stable version
* ``dev``: Test version with new features

Smaller fixes are directly pushed to the ``dev`` branch, major features are developed in separate feature branches.

The Git workflow will be improved in the future and versioned stable releases will be introduced.
